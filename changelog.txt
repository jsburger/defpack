// GENERAL CHANGES //

    Quartz Weapons:
       * Quartz weapons now have their own health (Max 3 HP), and every time the Player takes damage their HP is lowered by 1.
         At 0 HP the weapon is destroyed, leaving a Shard (a Melee weapon) behind.
       * Health can be regained by picking up quartz HP pickups.

    Mega Weapons:
       * All mega weapons slow down the Player by 20% if it is the active weapon (slowdown stacks with Steroids), and doesn't apply
         with Extra Feet

    Sonic Explosions:
       * Now apply "superforce", wich launches enemies at rapid speed, making them deal and take damage when colliding with walls and
         enemies
       * Added crown of Death synergy for sonic explosions

    Abris Weapons:
       * Removed size gain when colliding with a wall
       * All Abris Launchers (except Auto Abris Launchers) now lock onto targets close enough to the Players cursor. Lockon distance
         scales with accuracy

    Defpack Chests:
       * Will try to drop 2 different weapons if possible

   Themed Chests:
      * Defaults to dropping 1 weapon instead of no weapon if a suitable weapon can't be found
      * Added Themed weapon chests that drop for the following mods (mod must be loaded):
         + NTTE
         + Tinyweps
         + Loopweps
    	 + Nintendo Weapons
    	 + Downwell Weapons
    	 + Minecraft Weapons
    	 + Clasweps
    	 + Goodmod
    	 + I.D.P.D. Weapons
    	 + Delta Weapons
    	 + Xefsweps
    	 + Gunbucket
      * Added Hitscan chest

   Weapon Mutation Chests:
      * weapon chests that drop 2 weapons of a specific ammo type, indicated by the symbol on its lid
      * Taking weapon mutations increases overall chance of spawning a weapon mutation chest, and specifies
        what ammo type the Chest will be (e.g. having only Laser Brain will only spawn energy weapon chests,
        having Boiling Veins and Long Arms grants an equal chance of spawning an explosive or melee weapon chest, etc...)
      * Taking Heavy Heart guarantees all 2eapon chests to be themed weapon chests instead
      * Crown of Guns and Crown of Exchange also increase spawn chance, without specifying what ammo type weapon they will drop

    Other Changes:
       * Added NTS examination quotes for most weapons
       * Vectors now strongly drag enemies with them
       * Crits deal area damage around the point of impact and remove projectiles in that same area
       * Weapons with charges are canceled and ammo is refunded when swapping weapons
       * Added more extensive mod support for Blaacskills, especially Compound Elbow and Excited Neurons (Focus is still kinda busted)
       * Added Sodas for a few other mods (Metamorphosis, NTTE, Goodmod)
       * Many, many sprite updates, both small and large
